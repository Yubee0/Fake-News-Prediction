            UML rival factions in war of words
         KATHMANDU, MARCH 16 Leaders of the CPN-UML faction led by Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal and those in party Chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's camp today continued their diatribe against each other. While the PM said he would take action against leaders of the Nepal-Khanal faction if they went ahead with their planned national cadres meet scheduled to begin tomorrow, the rival faction said it would not be cowed down by the PM's threat and would hold the meeting as planned. The Nepal-Khanal faction, which boycotted a tea reception hosted by Oli today, orgainsed a press conference here and said that the Oli faction needed to rescind its March 12 decisions if it wanted to keep party unity intact. On March 12, Oli called a special meeting of the party's Central Committee and unilaterally amended the party statute and divested leaders of the Nepal-Khanal faction of key responsibilities. Surendra Prasad Pandey of the Nepal-Khanal faction said at the press conference that Oli was trying to split the party by not keeping party committees intact as they were before the merger between the UML and CPN-MC. ""If Oli rescinds his March 12 decisions, then that can be the basis of party unity,"" Pandey said. He criticised the PM for acting against the party's rules and statute. ""First, Oli disintegrated the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and now he is trying to break the UML,"" he added. Lawmaker Yogesh Bhattarai said the PM used the language of threat against leaders of the Nepal-Khanal faction and cadres but they were ready to face action for their cause. Bishnu Rijal said the Nepal-Khanal faction was all set to hold the two-day national cadres meet where around 2,000 leaders and cadres representing all wings of the party would take part. He said a concept paper would be presented in the meeting and it would be passed incorporating suggestions of the participants. A press release issued at the press conference stated that the national cadres' meet was aimed at ending Oli's monopoly and protecting the norms of people's multi-party democracy. Meanwhile, Oli spoke in a similar vein against leaders of the Nepal-Khanal faction at a tea reception organised at Baluwatar. He accused Nepal and Khanal, who did not attend the tea party, of anti-party activities. He said the Nepal-Khanal faction was defying party rules by deciding to organise a national cadres meeting. ""They did not attend the tea reception. I hear that they are going to organise a national cadres meet tomorrow where they will also pass a report. I can no longer tolerate anti-party activities,"" Oli said. Khanal and Nepal had aligned with CPN-MC Chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal before the nullification of the NCP (NCP) and had sought the PM's resignation. They had vehemently opposed Oli's decision to dissolve the House of Representatives, which was eventually reinstated by the Supreme Court last month. The Nepal-Dahal faction of the NCP had removed Oli as party co-chair and sacked him even from the party's general membership. Later, the Supreme Court nullified the NCP and revived CPN-UML and CPN-MC.A version of this article appears in the print on March 17, 2021, of The Himalayan Times."

            Oli firm on decision to amend UML statute
         KATHMANDU, MARCH 26 Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who chairs CPN-UML, today told the UML's parliamentary party that he would not rescind the March 12 decision to amend the party's statute and induct 23 former Maoist leaders in the party's central committee. The rival faction of the party led by Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal had claimed that those decisions violated the party's statute, but Oli said they were taken by valid party bodies. UML lawmakers from the rival faction had boycotted the parliamentary party meeting held on March 18 and 20, but most of them attended today's meeting and challenged Oli's March 12 decision. Lawmaker Jeevan Ram Shrestha told mediapersons that Khanal raised the concerns of lawmakers close to Nepal and Khanal. Khanal told Oli that to keep the party intact he should revive all the party committees that existed before the UML's merger with the CPN-Maoist Centre. UML Chief Whip Bishal Bhattarai told mediapersons that Oli denounced the clarification letter submitted by Madhav Kumar Nepal and Bhim Bahadur Rawal and threatened punitive action against them. Both stayed away from the parliamentary meeting today as well. ""The next central committee meeting will decide the punitive action Nepal and Rawal might face,"" Bhattarai said. Oli said Ghanashyam Bhusal and Surendra Prasad Pandey would furnish a better explanation than Nepal and Rawal. Bhusal and Pandey were also told to furnish an explanation for anti-party activities. According to UML Chief Whip Bishal Bhattarai, the PM said he was ready to listen to personal grievances of party lawmakers, but would not tolerate factionalism within the party. Oli said the House of Representatives would be prorogued soon as the government was preparing to call the budget session in April. Minister of Finance Bishnu Prasad Paudel asked party lawmakers to submit their development project plans for the new fiscal budget. Meanwhile, the Nepal-Khanal faction, which had sided with Pushpa Kamal Dahal in the Nepal Communist Party (NCP), held its central committee meeting here today and decided to fight against Oli from within the party. Raghuji Panta said 60 central committee members, mainly from around Kathmandu valley, took part in the central committee meeting and decided to continue to fight for their cause from within the party. ""We have decided to fight for our cause from within the party to make UML a strong and dynamic party that follows party rules and norms,"" Panta added.A version of this article appears in the print on March 27, 2021, of The Himalayan Times."

            PM must seek trust vote by April 5: CPN-MC
         KATHMANDU, MARCH 31 Chief Whip of CPN-Maoist Centre Dev Prasad Gurung today said in the House of Representatives that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli must seek a vote of confidence by April 5. He said the PM was required to seek a vote of confidence within one month of the Supreme Court's verdict that annulled unification between the CPN-UML and CPN-Maoist Centre. A division bench of justices Bam Kumar Shrestha and Kumar Regmi had on March 7 annulled the unification of the two left parties. Speaking in the HoR today, Gurung said that as per Article 100 (2) of the constitution, the PM was required to seek a vote of confidence within a month of the SC verdict nullifying the unification of the CPN-UML and the CPN-MC. He said if the government sought a vote of confidence within 30 days of the SC verdict, it would be considered legal, otherwise questions about the legality of the government would be raised. Article 100 (2) states that in case the prime minister's party splits or a coalition partner withdraws support, the PM should seek a vote of confidence within 30 days. He said the Oli-led government was a caretaker government, whether the PM agreed or not. Gurung said on February 23, the Supreme Court reinstated only the HoR, not the government. He said whenever the House was dissolved, the government of the day became a caretaker government. Gurung said the government was not giving business to the Parliament to prove that the PM was right in dissolving the HoR. ""The PM still seems to be trying to dissolve the House of Representatives. The government has not accepted the Supreme Court's verdict that reinstated the HoR,"" Gurung said. He said the government wanted snap polls, but the constitution had stipulated that the government should complete five years. The SC in its February 23 ruling had said the government must run for five years and the HoR could be dissolved only when the HoR failed to give a new government. A version of this article appears in the print on April 1, 2021, of The Himalayan Times."

Among those sued by the anti-graft body include rural municipality Chairperson Govinda Bahadur Khadka, Chief Administrative Officer Raju Prasad Neupane, accountant Durga Bahadur Dimdong, proprietor of Kathmandu-based Pike Construction Pvt Ltd., and 21 officials of various electrification users' committees. According to the CIAA, rural municipality chairperson Khadka in cahoots with other defendants had procured construction materials and equipment for electrification in the wards 1, 4 and 5 of the local level without inviting tenders. He unilaterally formed electrification users' committee at each ward to serve himself in misusing the state fund. It has also been found that Khadka did not even conduct a technical audit of the electrification. The construction materials were procured from the Pike Construction Pvt Ltd directly in contravention of the existing Public Procurement Act and Rule. As per the law, any public body is required to make procurement through open competition among qualified bidders by inviting tender. CIAA spokesperson Shyam Prasad Bhandari said the anti-graft body had sought maximum punishment against the defendants, along with a fine equivalent to the amount in question under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002.

            Conspiracy being hatched to break alliance: PM Deuba
         KATHMANDU, APRIL 19 Nepali Congress President and Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has claimed that a plot was being made to break the existing coalition in the government. So a caution should be adopted, he said at an event organised here today on the occasion of the 53rd anniversary of the Nepal Student Union (NSU), a student wing of the NC. ""The alliance has benefited the NC. We have got chief minister and ministers in most provinces. I feel that I have done good works in the NC. The existing political alliance should not be broken at present. There is no situation wherein a single party gets majority in the poll. So it should continue."" The NC President was of the view that the NSU should reach villages and school-level to increase its significance and meaning. ""NSU has its presence in colleges and campuses across the nation, but why it is losing the free student union elections,"" he questioned adding that it required consolidating its foundations right from the school level. Citing that he was also the NSU President in the past and students should dream of reaching the noted posts of Prime Minister and President in the future, he took time to urge students to explore excellence in academic career as well. He further claimed that no force would defeat the party in the upcoming elections provided that it remained integrated and intact. On the occasion, the PM Deuba honoured NSU founding President Bipin Koirala, vice-president Sanad Regmi, general secretary Tika Pokhrel, members Ramchandra Poudel, Surendra Bahadur Bist, Kedar Neupane, Damodar Gautam, Chakraraj Pant, Basant Gurung and Rajendra Bahadur Shah among others."

            Nepal's top court gives temporary reprieve to central bank governor
         KATHMANDU, APRIL 19 Nepal's Supreme Court issued a provisional order on Tuesday putting a temporary stay on the government's suspension of the central bank governor until the next hearing, a lawyer said. Maha Prasad Adhikari was suspended on April 8 as governor of the central Nepal Rastra Bank by the government, which named his deputy the interim chief. After the ruling, he now looks set to resume work on Wednesday, tackling the Himalayan country's economic challenges, with foreign reserves hit by the slump in tourism during the pandemic and remittances also suffering. The finance ministry has not said why Adhikari was suspended, saying only a government panel would investigate the matter. Neither the central bank nor Adhikari have commented, but a government official said Adhikari had been accused of leaking sensitive financial information to the media. Adhikari filed a petition to the Supreme Court demanding an interim order against his suspension, saying it was illegal. At the end of the hearing, Judge Hari Prasad Phuyal ordered the government not to ""immediately implement the decision and to allow the petitioner to resume his work as usual"", Tikaram Bhattarai, Adhikari's lawyer, told Reuters. Adhikari was not immediately available for comment but told Nepali news outlet Kantipur online the court order had provided ""additional protection to the autonomy"" of the central bank. His lawyers said he would be able to return to the central bank on Wednesday as governor. A government spokesman was not immediately available to comment on the court order. The judge ordered both sides to be present on April 26 when the court will take a decision on whether to issue an interim order as demanded by the petitioner. ""We have challenged the legality of the government's decision to order a probe panel against the governor and I am confident that the court will give its interim order after the next hearing on April 26,"" the lawyer said."
