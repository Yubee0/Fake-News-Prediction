            PM warns against forces' bid to reverse republicanism
         KATHMANDU, MARCH 13 Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that one section of society was still hell bent on reversing the republican order, proportional inclusion and the rights won by oppressed classes and groups. He said he could not be defeated by any power of the world as long as he remained committed to the nation and people. Addressing a programme here today, the PM said if anybody had negative views on the peace process and leaders who led the peace process, who played a leading role during the constitution making process, then those elements would not succeed and ultimately the people of the country would succeed. ""Some people are still trying to reverse the current political gains,"" he added. He said the filing of case against him had created ripples in society but that had helped bring all Maoist forces together to unite. He said that after a writ petition was filed seeking to register a case against him, he viewed his responsibility to move ahead with the TRC Act (Amendment) Bill. The PM said since the court order was not against the peace process, there was nothing to worry about. ""We should not worry, but we should remain alert all the time,"" he added, ""If we cannot remain vigilant and if we cannot continue to strengthen the party and unite forward looking revolutionary forces, then those forces that want to weaken us, will continue to do that."" Recently the Supreme Court granted permission to some conflict victims to file case against PM Dahal for his 2020 speech in which he had said he could take responsibility for only 5,000 Maoist insurgency era deaths and not all 17,000 deaths. The Supreme Court, however, refused to issue an interim order against the prime minister. ""A few days ago, it appeared that something was happening against the peace process and the prime minister, but I think that it is helping us because it has inspired all Maoist forces to come together and I am confident that there shall be a broader unity among us,"" the PM added. He said he had immediately called a Cabinet meeting and decided to move the TRC (Amendment) bill ahead and registered the bill in the Parliament. The PM said Maoist forces should develop the constitution by revising it to expand people's rights to build the foundation of socialism. He said progressive provisions in the constitution were incorporated as a result of the sacrifices of people. The PM said he would present the federal education bill this session and try his best to get the bill passed as soon as possible.

At the ceremony, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal presented a farewell gift to outgoing President Bidhya Devi Bhandari on behalf of the Government of Nepal. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, National Assembly Chairman Ganesh Prasad Timilsina and other high-ranking government officials were also present on the occasion. Paudel was elected president on March 9. Last week, Chief Election Commissioner Dinesh Kumar Thapaliya submitted a report to President Bhandari saying Ramchandra Paudel had been elected the new pesident in accordance with Article 62 of the constitution and Article 60 of the President and Vice-president Election Act, 2019 (2074).

President Paudel has traversed a long political journey to make it to the country's highest position. Paudel was born on 14 October 1944 to Durga Prasad Paudel and Rishi Maya Paudel. He hails from Byas Municipality of Tanahun district. He entered politics at the age of 15. He spent 15 years in prison. People close to him say that he rose as a leader because of his politically conscious family background. Paudel, who was once the acting president of Nepali Congress, has held important positions, including deputy prime minister. He was contender for prime minister several times, but he was defeated each time because he could not get majority. Political analyst Vijay Mishra said ""President Ramchandra Paudel is a 'neutral personality' politically."" ""His party and all coalition members appreciated him by voting him as head of state. He is the only controversy-free and untainted leader,""added Mishra. Political Science Professor Lok Raj Baral said, ""Paudel is a veteran and the most experienced politician at the moment and he is a perfect fit for the post of president.""

 Ram Chandra Poudel was elected Thursday by members of the Federal Parliament and provincial assemblies. Top officials, diplomats and Parliament members lined up to congratulate the new president at the ceremony where the military band played national songs and gave him a salute. Outgoing President Bidhya Devi Bhandari, having completed the maximum two terms in office, passed the position on immediately after the swearing-in ceremony. The president is largely a figurehead with little political power. But the election triggered a feud among partners in the governing alliance headed by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who took office in December after a hung parliament left a fragile coalition government. Dahal backed Poudel, who is also now the supreme commander of the Nepalese army, angering his main coalition partner, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist), which backed Subash Chandra Nembang, its own candidate. The party has since pulled out of the coalition, threatening Dahal's control. Dahal has since lost the support of three key political parties that were part of his initial coalition government, and must seek a vote of confidence in parliament later in March to continue in power. There was no clear explanation of why Dahal decided to back the opposition candidate and endanger his alliance, but struggles for power among the main political parties are common. The country has had eight different governments in the past 10 years.

            Election officer refuses to revoke Yadav's candidacy
         KATHMANDU, MARCH 12 The Election Officer's Office has refused to cancel the candidacy of Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav for the vice-presidential election. Election Officer Mahesh Sharma Paudel informed that Yadav's candidacy would continue. Talking to the media, he said, ""Since it can be said that a male candidate from the Madhes community is more qualified to be a candidate for the vice-president rather than that of Khas-Arya community, the claims of vice-presidential candidates Ashtalakshmi Shakya and Mamta Jha cannot be upheld."" ""That's why, Yadav's nomination letter should not be rejected,"" said Election Officer Paudel. Four people, including Yadav, are competing for the post of the vice-president. The Election Commission has given time till 4:00pm today to the vice-president candidates to withdraw their nominations. Voting for the election of the vice-president will be held on March 17 from 10:00am to 3:00pm at the Federal Parliament building complex in New Baneshwor. The Election Commission has already announced the names of 882 voters in the National Assembly, the House of Representatives and the provincial assemblies The incumbent Vice-president Nanda Bahadur Pun's second term is ending on March 17. Two separate complaints were lodged against the Janata Samajwadi Party's vice-presidential candidate Yadav on behalf of CPNUML and Janamat Party candidates. The complainant claimed that since the male candidate Ramchandra Paudel had been elected as the president, only women could run for the post of vice-president. UML lawmaker Mahesh Bartaula, who had seconded the candidacy of party's official candidate Asta Laxmi Shakya, and Mamata Jha, a vice-presidential candidate from the Janamat Party, had lodged complaint with the Office of the Election Officer against Yadav. They had claimed that the nomination of a male candidate could not be registered for the vice-president's post as a male had already been elected the president. On Friday, the Election Commission had issued a statement saying only women candidates from communities other than Khas-Arya would be registered for the vice-presidential election. Chief Election Commissioner Dinesh Thapaliya had said that the Election Commission would register the candidacy of only female candidates from Dalit, Indigenous nationalities, Muslim, Madhesi or Tharu communities. A total of four candidates - three from the ruling alliance and one from the UML - have registered their nominations for the vice-presidential election. Submitting his clarification today, Yadav claimed that there was a provision in the constitution that the president and vice-president should be from a different gender or community. Yadav has demanded that the complaint against his candidature be scrapped as he belongs to a different community than Paudel, who was elected as the president. Patan High Court Judge Mahesh Sharma Paudel has been appointed as the chief electoral officer for the vice-presidential election. The constitution stipulates that the post of president and vice-president should be a person of different gender or community. Earlier, Chief Election Commissioner Dinesh Kumar Thapaliya had said that only women except the Khas-Arya community could run for the post of vice-president. Article 70 of the constitution states that the election of the president and vice-president shall be done in such a way that different genders or communities are represented."

""They should all be subject to the law of the land,"" he told the BBC.  On Tuesday police clashed with supporters of Mr Khan, a former prime minister, outside his residence as they tried to detain him on a court order.  He is facing allegations he sold state gifts while in office. He says the case is politically motivated. There was a tense situation outside his compound in the city of Lahore as police tried to force their way in.  Officers fired tear gas shells to disperse supporters of Mr Khan, who threw stones and bricks.  In a video address, the politician, 70, offered to sign a guarantee that he will appear in an Islamabad court on Saturday. He added that there were security concerns as two militant attacks had previously taken place at the court.  Mr Khan claimed there was ""no reason"" for police to arrest him on Tuesday as he had taken protective bail until Saturday. He also said the government was determined to put him behind bars after previous failed attempts. ""I'm mentally prepared that I'm going to be spending my night in a cell,"" he said on Tuesday. ""I don't know how many nights, but I'm all prepared for that."" The former prime minister showed what he said were tear gas cannisters, which he said had been fired into his property.  He said the authorities were trying to arrest him to stop his party from taking part in forthcoming elections. But he added: ""Whether I am in jail or not they will not be able to stop my party winning."" Government minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the move had nothing to do with elections and police were only complying with court orders to arrest him over corruption cases.  She claimed that Mr Khan was using his party workers, women and children as human shields to evade arrest and stoke unrest. Mr Khan's supporters are also holding protests in other cities. He was ousted as prime minister last April but has kept up pressure on his successor Shehbaz Sharif with demonstrations and speeches calling for elections due later this year to be held early.

Gun control: Biden to sign executive order on background checks,"Gun control: Biden to sign executive order on background checks US President Joe Biden is set to issue an executive order that aims to increase the number of background checks conducted before firearm sales. It aims to move the US ""as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation"". The Democratic president will sign the measure during a visit Tuesday to Monterey Park, California, where a gunman killed 11 people in January. Action on gun control appears unlikely in a divided Washington. Last year, Mr Biden signed a cross-party gun violence reduction measure into law and he has repeatedly asked Congress to do more about what he calls an ""epidemic"". But his call for an assault weapons ban, universal background checks on gun sales and repealing gun manufacturers' immunity from prosecution are unlikely to make headway while Republicans control the US House of Representatives. Mr Biden's executive order  - which does not require the approval of Congress - acknowledges this political reality and lays out a series of actions within his authority, beginning with the expansion of background checks. Universal background checks - or the requirement to run a gun buyer's information through an FBI database before a sale is made - are seen as key to closing legal loopholes that allow prohibited purchases and are supported by a broad majority of the American public. But legislation that requires criminal background checks for all guns sales has languished in the Senate with even some Democrats opposing it. Tuesday's order aims to crack down on gun sellers who break the law. Mr Biden will direct the US attorney general to clarify the statutory definition of who is ""engaged in the business"" of dealing in firearms, to devise a plan that prevents firearms dealers whose licenses were revoked from continuing to sell, and to name and shame firearms dealers who are breaking the law. Kris Brown, president of the gun control non-profit Brady, wrote on Twitter: ""While we still need urgent legislative action from Congress, [the president's] announcement today gets us closer to universal background checks than any other President that has come before."" The executive order also calls for a proposal on how the federal government can meet the short and long-term needs of a community impacted by mass shootings, similar to how authorities respond to natural disasters. Separately, the measure asks the Federal Trade Commission to issue a report on how gun manufacturers target civilians, especially minors. It also aims to reduce the theft or loss of firearms during shipment between dealers, and mandate better reporting of ballistics data so law enforcement can match shell casings to the guns from which they were fired. The president's directive includes a call for raising public awareness over safe firearm storage and over ""red flag"" laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders. Signed in 19 states and the District of Columbia, these laws allow individuals to petition a court to temporarily confiscate guns from people with potentially violent or harmful behaviour. Last month, the Justice Department sent out more than $200m to help states administer their red flag laws. Reaction to the executive order was largely positive on Tuesday. The Everytown gun control coalition wrote it ""would improve community safety, hold the gun industry and rogue gun dealers in our communities accountable, and save lives"", while the Moms Demand Action grassroots group added that it will ""double down on the progress made"" in last year's bill."
Aukus submarine deal: Is conflict with China getting closer?,"Aukus submarine deal: Is conflict with China getting closer? China has reacted with predictable anger to this week's official announcement of the so-called Aukus pact.  The details, unveiled on Monday in San Diego, bind together Australia, the UK and the US in a far-reaching defence and security alliance aimed at confronting Chinese military expansion in the Indo-Pacific region. ""Going down a dangerous road"", ""disregarding the concerns of the international community"" and even ""risking a new arms race and nuclear proliferation"" are just some of the accusations being levelled by Beijing at this trio of western allies. Not since the US Congressional leader Nancy Pelosi made her controversial visit to Taiwan last summer has China expressed such intense disapproval of Western actions.  China, the world's most populous nation, with the world's largest army and navy, says it is starting to feel ""penned in"" by the US and its allies in the western Pacific. In response, President Xi Jinping announced recently that China would accelerate the expansion of its defence spending and named national security as the primary concern of the coming years. Little wonder then that UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke this week about a dangerous decade ahead and the need to gear up to meet the growing security challenges. So how did we get to this point and is the world drawing closer to a catastrophic conflict in the Pacific between China and the US and its allies? The West got it wrong on China. For years there was a naïve assumption in foreign ministries that China's economic liberalisation would inevitably lead to an opening up of society and greater political freedom. As western multinational companies set up joint ventures and hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens began to enjoy a higher standard of living then surely, the reasoning went, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) would loosen its grip on the population, allow some modest democratic reforms and become a fully-fledged member of the so-called ""rules-based international order"". But it hasn't worked out that way. Yes, China has become an economic giant, a vital, integral part of the global supply chain and the most important trading partner for countries all over the world. But instead of coupling this with a shift towards democracy and liberalisation, Beijing has embarked on a course that has alarmed both Western governments and many of its neighbours like Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. Such as? The list is long but here are the main bones of contention between China and the West: Militarily, China today is a force to be reckoned with. In recent years its People's Liberation Army has made enormous strides in technology and innovation as well as numbers. China's Dong Feng hypersonic missiles, for example, can travel at speeds in excess of Mach 5 (five times the speed of sound), armed with either a high explosive or nuclear warhead. This is giving the US Navy's 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, pause for thought as to just how close it is prepared to risk sailing to China's massed missile batteries onshore. On nuclear ballistic missiles too, China has embarked on a programme of rapid expansion, aiming to treble its number of warheads as it builds new silos out in remote western regions.  None of this though, means that China wants to go to war. It doesn't. When it comes to Taiwan, it would much prefer to exert enough pressure on it that it capitulates and submits to Beijing's rule without a shot being fired. On Hong Kong, the Uyghurs and intellectual property it knows that over time the criticism will die down because trade with China is simply too important for the rest of the world.  So although tensions are high right now, and there could well be flashpoints still to come, both sides - China and the West - know that a war in the Pacific would be catastrophic for everyone and despite the angry rhetoric, it is in absolutely no-one's interests. Suppressing China won't make US great - Beijing Allies unveil new details of nuclear submarine deal Sunak: China represents challenge to world order Submarine deal sends powerful message to China"
"Aukus deal: US, UK and Australia agree on nuclear submarine project","Aukus deal: US, UK and Australia agree on nuclear submarine project This video can not be played Joe Biden: ""Nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed subs"" The US, UK and Australia have unveiled details of their plan to create a new fleet of nuclear-powered submarines, aimed at countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Under the Aukus pact Australia is to get its first nuclear-powered subs - at least three - from the US. The allies will also work to create a new fleet using cutting-edge tech, including UK-made Rolls-Royce reactors. Beijing has strongly criticised the significant naval deal. Its foreign ministry on Tuesday accused the three nations of ""walking further and further down the path of error and danger"". China's UN mission had earlier also accused the Western allies of setting back nuclear non-proliferation efforts. But US President Joe Biden said the deal was aimed at bolstering peace in the region and stressed the submarines would be ""nuclear-powered, not nuclear-armed"".  Speaking alongside the UK and Australian prime ministers - Rishi Sunak and Anthony Albanese - in San Diego, California, Mr Biden said the deal would not jeopardise Australia's commitment to being a nuclear-free country.  For Australia, it is a major upgrade to the US ally's military capabilities. The country becomes just the second after the UK to receive Washington's elite nuclear propulsion technology.  The submarines will be able to operate further and faster than the country's existing diesel-engine fleet and Australia will also be able to carry out long-range strikes against enemies for the first time.  Under the deal, Australian navy sailors will be sent to US and UK submarine bases from this year to learn how to use the nuclear-powered submarines. From 2027, the US and UK will also base a small number of nuclear submarines in Perth, Western Australia, before Canberra will buy three US-model Virginia-class submarines in the early 2030s - with options to purchase two more.  After that, the plan is to design and build an entirely new nuclear-powered submarine for the UK and Australian navies - a model that is being called SSN-AUKUS.  This attack craft will be built in Britain and Australia to a British design, but use technology from all three countries. President Biden said all three countries were committed to ensuring the Indo-Pacific region would remain free and open.  ""Forging this new partnership, we're showing again how democracies can deliver our own security and prosperity... not just for us but for the entire world,"" he said. He also pledged of $4.6bn (£3.7bn) to expanding the US' submarine construction capacity and improving maintenance of its current nuclear-powered Virginia-class submarines. Australia's PM said the plan - which will cost Canberra up to A$368bn (£201bn) over 30 years - marked the ""biggest single investment in Australia's defence capability in all of its history"". Anthony Albanese said building the submarines in Australian shipyards would also create thousands of local jobs. The UK PM also said thousands of jobs would be created in Derby and Barrow-in-Furness, where some of the construction would take place. Mr Sunak said that in the 18 months since the Aukus alliance was unveiled, the challenges to global stability had only grown.  ""Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, China's growing assertiveness, the destabilising behaviour of Iran and North Korea - all threaten to create a world codefined by danger, disorder and division,"" Mr Sunak said. As part of his visit to the US, Mr Sunak has also pledged to increase defence spending by nearly £5bn ($6bn) over the next two years to counter threats from hostile states. The Aukus security alliance - announced in September 2021 - has repeatedly drawn criticism from China. Beijing's foreign ministry last week reiterated its position that the pact risked creating an arms race. But the three Western countries say the security deal is aimed at shoring up stability in the Indo-Pacific.  While all three leaders have stressed how the deal will strengthen their co-operation, it hasn't been without its political fallout. In 2021, Australia scrapped a multi-million dollar diesel-powered submarine agreement with France in favour of the trilateral agreement - causing a political rift with Paris.  Australia also faces a delicate diplomatic situation with China - its largest trading partner. Analysts say the question will be whether it can continue to strengthen its military ties with US, while fostering commercial ties with Beijing. Submarine deal sends powerful message to China Sunak: China represents challenge to world order Sunak in US to finalise Aukus defence pact Australia's big gamble on the US over China"
Aukus: Australia's big gamble on the US over China,"Aukus: Australia's big gamble on the US over China This video can not be played The security pact enables Australia to build nuclear-powered submarines for the first time By signing the Aukus pact last week, Australia revealed where it stands in the world: It is taking the side of the US over China. It's a definitive move for a country in the Asia-Pacific region, experts say. The security deal with the US (and the UK) gives Australia a huge defence upgrade from the world's most powerful military. But it's a gift with strings attached. And there is debate over whether such a decision - made without public consultation - will play out in Australia's national interests. As China has grown in power, it has begun to challenge US dominance in the Asia-Pacific region. China has built the world's largest navy and has become increasingly assertive over contested areas such as the South China Sea.  Australia had long maintained it didn't have to choose between the two powers, but in recent years its attitude towards Beijing has hardened.   China has been suspected of interfering in Australian politics and of cyber attacks on key institutions.  Tensions were further inflamed last year when Australia called for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. A flurry of Chinese sanctions against Australian exports followed.  That was Australia's ""a-ha"" moment, says John Blaxland, an international security professor at the Australian National University. ""What happened was the dawning realisation that all these things that had preceded weren't benign,"" he says. ""We were talking about a country that had become surprisingly hostile."" Australia realised it needed to improve its defences - and quickly. On that front, Aukus is a big coup for the country. The pact will give Australia access to nuclear-powered submarines and long-range missiles from US technology. This ""super-enables an otherwise pedestrian middle-ranking military capability of little consequence beyond its border"", says Prof Blaxland. In the event of conflict, Australia would also for the first time have the ability to strike adversaries from a distance. ""This is about giving the Australian Defence Force a capable edge in a region where the capability of our own defence force when matched against China is going backwards,"" said Richard Maude, a former top Australian security official and now policy director at Asia Society Australia. For the US, it's a pretty big deal to share the crown jewels of its defence technology. But Washington views this ""one off"" trade as a crucial move in wider efforts to keep China at bay, experts say. As China projects naval power into the region, Australia's fleet - albeit small and some way off being completed - will be some form of counter alongside roving US forces, they add. ""We're trying to play catch-up by developing a credible deterrence to reduce prospects of war,"" says Prof Blaxland.  ""Because at the moment our deterrence is simply not credible. China can essentially act against us with a degree of impunity. That is becoming politically intolerable."" Critics argue Australia has given up its strategic ambiguity and made itself a bigger target because of the pact. ""The way in which it was announced rips away any pretence that Australia was not firmly on the side of containing China militarily,"" says Prof Allan Gyngell, president of the Australian Institute of International Affairs. Analysts warn Australia will probably face more economic retaliations from its biggest trading partner. ""The countries were a long way off returning to diplomatic normality and this only exacerbates that,"" says Dr Lai-Ha Chan from the University of Technology, Sydney. Others say Aukus also locks Australia in with the US for generations to come.  In the future, Australia may struggle to retain autonomy over decisions in its best interests. It will be reliant on foreign nuclear technology. ""We can't operate the submarines ourselves. So in effect we are ceding some of our sovereignty to the US, and maybe Britain,"" Prof Gyngell says. ""It will become therefore impossible for the major strike capacity of the Australian navy to operate without a US veto."" He says it also returns Australia to being ""a smaller partner in the Anglosphere"", despite it making noises in recent times about centring itself in Asia. ""We're hanging out again with the people we're comfortable with, ditching efforts to build closer relations with others in our region,"" Prof Gyngell says. ""That is a problem."" Mr Maude also highlights the risk where South-East Asia will ""increasingly feel that Australia regards security of the region as something that can only be managed by other major Western powers."" It's already caused some backlash within the Asean group of 10 South-East Asian nations. Indonesia has cancelled a meeting with Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison, and Malaysia has warned the pact is a ""catalyst for a nuclear arms race"". Analyst James Chin, from the University of Tasmania, says that Aukus ""reinforces the idea that the opinions of the Asean members matter little when it comes to the superpowers and how they operate in the region."" That said, some analysts say many smaller Asian nations are happy for the US, UK and Australia to make bold moves. ""In private, the pundits will tell you: 'We think you Australians are clod-hopping, ham-fisted and culturally insensitive but we don't dislike what you're actually doing. We just dislike how you're doing it - we'd like you to talk to us before you do it so we feel more included and appreciated,'"" says Prof Blaxland. Most experts say Australia has mishandled its diplomacy around Aukus. It also gravely offended France in reneging on the previous submarine deal. That's a poor sign, experts say, because international relations is as much about diplomacy - as it is about military pacts. It is in Australia's interests - and other democracies - for the US to maintain its dominance in the region, analysts say.  But scholars are fundamentally divided on the best way to achieve that. Some say a more cautious approach is needed; more hawkish voices say China won't respond to anything but a show of force. One thing seems certain - we're headed for a period of greater tension. ""We're used to East Asia being a place of calm in a world. That's no longer going to be true,"" says Prof Gyngell. ""So foreign policy and defence is going to impinge more on the lives of ordinary Australians than it has in past decades. Things are coming closer to home."" UK, US and Australia launch pact to counter China Aukus pact could signal power shift in Asia-Pacific UK defends submarine deal amid criticism Aukus pact delivers France some hard truths What might happen next in the South China Sea?"
Aukus pact delivers France some hard truths,"Aukus pact delivers France some hard truths When they have picked themselves up from their humiliation, the French will need to gather their sangfroid and confront some cruel verities. Number one: there is no sentiment in geostrategy.  The French must see there is no point in wailing about having been shoddily treated. They were.  But who ever heard of a nation short-changing its defence priorities out of not wanting to give offence? The fact is that the Australians calculated they had underestimated the Chinese threat and so needed to boost their level of deterrence. They acted with steely disregard for French concerns but, when it comes to the crunch, that is what nations do. It is almost the definition of a nation: a group of people who have come together to defend their own interests. Their own, not others'. Of course, sometimes nations decide their interests are best served by joining alliances. That's what the US did in suppressing its isolationist instincts in the last century. But the second painful truth exposed by the Aukus affair is that the US no longer has any great interest in the outdated behemoth that is Nato. Nor does it harbour any particular loyalty to those who have stood by its side. Gaullists in France - and President Emmanuel Macron is one of them - dream of their country as a fully independent power, exercising its force for good thanks to a global presence and nuclear-backed military strength. In practice, and not without considerable reserve, France has bound itself to the US-led alliance because that seemed both moral and expedient. But now the questions echo around Paris: Why did we bother? What was in it for us? ""This blow came completely out of the blue,"" says Renaud Girard, senior foreign affairs analyst at Le Figaro newspaper. ""Macron made so much effort to help the Anglo-Saxons. With the Americans in Afghanistan; with the British on military co-operation; with the Australians in the Indo-Pacific. Look, he kept saying, we're following you - we are genuine allies. ""And he made the effort not just with Biden - but with Trump too!  All that, and then this. No reward at all. Treated like dogs."" The French will now be re-evaluating their role in Nato. Their military participation in the organisation was suspended by De Gaulle in 1966 and only restored by Nicolas Sarkozy in 2009. There is no talk, yet, of a second withdrawal. But remember, Emmanuel Macron is the man who described Nato two years ago as ""brain-dead"". He will not have changed his mind. This video can not be played Australia’s ‘risky bet’ to side with US over China But the third harsh truth is that there is no obvious other way for France to fulfil its global ambitions. The lesson of the last week is that France by itself is too small to make much of a dent in strategic affairs.  Every four years the Chinese build as many ships as there are in the entire French fleet. When it came to the crunch, the Australians preferred to be close to a superpower, not a minipower. The conventional way out of the conundrum has been for the French to say their military future lies in Europe. The EU - with its vast population and technological resources - would be the springboard for France's global mission. But 30 years has given nothing beyond a few joint brigades, a bit of procurement planning and minor contingents from Estonia and the Czech Republic in Mali. For Renaud Girard, the idea of the EU as a military force is a ""complete joke"". So what can France do?  Accept realities. Try to form ad hoc alliances (like Macron was indeed trying to do in the Indo-Pacific).  Keep pushing the Germans to get over their 20th Century complexes and act like the power they really are. And keep open a doorway to the British. It may not be the easiest of suggestions at the moment. Relations between Paris and London are at their worst level for many years. The French find it hard to conceal their contempt for Boris Johnson, and many in London appear to feel the same way back. In the short term, it is quite possible that France will seek to punish the UK for its role in the Aukus affair, says Girard, possibly by scaling back the secret nuclear co-operation that forms part of the 2010 Lancaster Accords. There could be fall-out in other areas too, like the control of cross-Channel migrants. But the UK's is Europe's only other serious army. The two countries have similar histories and world experiences. Their soldiers respect each other. In the long term, Franco-British defence co-operation is too logical to ignore. That may be the last of Macron's painful truths.  France: US and Australia 'lying' over defence deal UK, US and Australia launch pact to counter China Aukus pact could signal power shift in Asia-Pacific"
Aukus: French minister condemns US and Australia 'lies' over security pact,"Aukus: French minister condemns US and Australia 'lies' over security pact This video can not be played Australia’s ‘risky bet’ to side with US over China France's foreign minister has accused Australia and the US of lying over a new security pact that prompted Paris to recall its ambassadors.  Jean-Yves Le Drian also accused the countries of ""duplicity, a major breach of trust and contempt"".  The pact, known as Aukus, thwarted a multibillion-dollar deal France had signed with Australia. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he had acted in the country's national interests. He insisted the French government ""would have had every reason to know that we had deep and grave concerns"" that the $37bn (£27bn) deal signed in 2016 - for France to build 12 conventional submarines - ""was not going to meet our strategic interests"". ""Of course it's a matter of great disappointment to the French government, so I understand their disappointment,"" he said. ""But at the same time, Australia like any sovereign nation must always take decisions that are in our sovereign national defence interest."" The Aukus agreement - which also includes the UK - will see Australia being given the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines as a way of countering China's influence in the contested South China Sea.  France was informed only hours before the public announcement was made earlier this week.  In an interview with France 2 television on Saturday, Mr Le Drian said a ""serious crisis"" was in progress between the allies.  ""The fact that for the first time in the history of relations between the United States and France we are recalling our ambassador for consultations is a serious political act, which shows the magnitude of the crisis that exists now between our countries,"" he told France 2.  He said the ambassadors were being recalled to ""re-evaluate the situation"".  But he said France had seen ""no need"" to recall its ambassador to the UK, as he accused the country of ""constant opportunism"".  ""Britain in this whole thing is a bit like the third wheel,"" he said.  Newly appointed UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss defended the agreement in an article for The Sunday Telegraph, saying it showed Britain's readiness to be ""hard-headed"" in defence of its interests. The pact means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. It will also see the allies share cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies. As he left Canberra on Saturday, French Ambassador Jean-Pierre Thebault called Australia's decision to unilaterally scrap the deal a ""huge mistake"". China meanwhile has accused the three powers involved in the security pact of having a ""Cold War mentality"". A White House official has said the Biden administration will engage with France in the coming days to resolve their differences. UK defends submarine deal amid criticism Defence pact an awkward wake-up call for Europe Aukus pact could signal power shift in Asia-Pacific Why is everyone fighting over the South China Sea?"
Aukus: Defence pact an awkward wake-up call for Europe,"Aukus: Defence pact an awkward wake-up call for Europe This video can not be played Watch: Australia’s ‘risky bet’ to side with US over China How do you even pronounce Aukus? Something along the lines of ""awkward"" came the wry suggestion from one Brussels diplomat this week. And while France has condemned the Australia-UK-US security pact as a ""stab in the back"", it is certainly awkward for the European Union too.  Firstly, because not only were they not in the room for discussions, they barely seemed to know the room existed. Josep Borrell is the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. A big title but one that had not, in this case, gained him any privileged access.  Aukus is being seen as a significant attempt to counter Chinese influence in the South China Sea.  And as Mr Borrell stood at the podium for a press briefing this week, to launch the EU's own Indo-Pacific strategy, the incoming questions were not so much about his announcement, but someone else's.  The foreign policy chief admitted he was not exactly ""glad"" at how the timings had clashed but also declared it was a wake-up call for Europe, that they had to take the initiative.  But that leads to a second awkwardness. How?  The EU is not a military power, although we heard calls this week from Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for a ""European Defence Union"". Cue eye-rolls amongst some who feel like they have heard it all before.  This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen said the EU had to develop the political will to act Even if the EU could figure out how to flex some more muscle, it would have to then decide what that was for.  And that would not be easy either.  ""The strategic environment does not look the same from Warsaw, Athens, Paris or Berlin,"" says Ian Lesser, vice-president of policy think tank The German Marshall Fund of the United States.  However, he suggests the European Union is pretty clear in terms of what it does not want, which goes to a third issue. The EU does not want to be caught in the middle as things escalate: to have to choose, as he puts it, ""between the United States and China in an increasingly fraught environment"".  Finally, member state France is seething. A significant military power in its own right, France has interests and a presence in the region. Its deal with Australia was a key part of its strategy there. The multibillion-dollar contract is one thing, the hit on a painstakingly constructed regional strategy another.  So, in summary, for the EU the timing was bad; the lack of forewarning a bit embarrassing, even if not that surprising. And, as Afghanistan did, it has thrown into sharper relief questions about the bloc's own strategic autonomy. Things heated up this week between the West and China and the EU did not quite know where to look.

Moody's warns of more pain for US banks as downgrades sector,"Moody's warns of more pain for US banks as downgrades sector This video can not be played Is this the start of a financial crisis? Ratings giant Moody's has warned of more pain ahead for the US banking system after a run on deposits led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Moody's cut its outlook for the sector to ""negative"" from stable, warning of ""a rapid deterioration in the operating environment"". The downgrade came as banking shares in the US and Europe rebounded following earlier losses. But Moody's said some other banks faced risks of customer withdrawals.  It said rising interest rates also pose a challenge, exposing banks that bought assets such as government bonds when interest rates were low, to potential losses. ""Banks with substantial unrealized securities losses and with non-retail and uninsured US depositors may still be more sensitive to depositor competition or ultimate flight,"" Moody's said in the report.  ""We expect pressures to persist and be exacerbated by ongoing monetary policy tightening, with interest rates likely to remain higher for longer until inflation returns to within the Fed's target range."" Authorities have acted quickly to try to contain fallout after the shock collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), the 16th largest in the US. The firm, a key lender to technology firms, failed last week after a rush of customer withdrawals, sparked by the bank's disclosure that it needed to raise money and had been forced to sell a portfolio of assets, mostly government bonds, at a loss. US regulators took over the bank and said they would guarantee deposits beyond the $250,000 level typically insured by the government. They took similar steps at smaller Signature Bank.  Officials from the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission are now investigating the collapse, US media reported. Reports have suggested that some customers of smaller US banks have been trying to put their money into bigger institutions. However, ratings agency S&P Global said it hadn't seen evidence of runs on banks other than at those that had collapsed. It said emergency measures brought in by the Federal Reserve should lower the risk of bank customers losing confidence. However, it added that ""conditions remain fluid"" and ""some banks are showing greater signs of stress than others"", including First Republic bank. Analysts expect the turmoil in the financial system sparked by the failures to lead the Fed to slow or pause its rate rises when it meets next week. That view gained traction on Tuesday after the latest inflation report showed prices in the US up 6% in the 12 months to February, in line with expectations, helping to boost shares. As trading began on Tuesday, San Francisco-based First Republic Bank - which had seen its share price tank by 62% on Monday - jumped more than 50%, one of a number of firms whose shares were staging a recovery. It ultimately closed roughly 30% higher.  The three main stock indexes also climbed, with the Dow up 1%, the S&P 500 climbing 1.7% and the Nasdaq ending the day more than 2% higher.  In the UK, bank shares - which saw sharp falls on Monday - were all mostly higher by Tuesday afternoon. The FTSE 100 ended up roughly 1.2%.  The European Stoxx banking index also opened lower on Tuesday but then recovered to end nearly 3% higher. But shares in HSBC, which rescued SVB's UK business for £1, closed down 1%, and there were steep losses overnight in Japan, where major lenders such as the country's largest bank MUFG, saw their share prices tumble by more than 8%.  An index of Japanese banking stocks, known as the Topix Banks Index, plunged by 7.4%, despite reassurances from the Bank of Japan (BoJ).  ""Japanese financial institutions' direct exposure to Silicon Valley Bank is small, and thus the impact is likely limited,"" said a BoJ official. How bad is US banking crisis and what does it mean?

Democrats scramble to reverse course on COVID restrictions ahead of midterms,"Democrats scramble to reverse course on COVID restrictions ahead of midterms Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., discusses Democrats’ decision to drop mask mandates around the country.  Democrats across the country are scrambling to reverse course on COVID-19 restrictions as this year's midterm elections loom.  With the notable exception of the White House, Democrats at every level are signaling their support for returning to normal as polls show Americans are weary of coronavirus restrictions, which Republican states have largely done away with.  According to a recent poll by Monmouth University, 70% of Americans say it’s time for the country to move on from the pandemic, and a decreasing number of Americans support COVID-related mandates. President Biden’s approval ratings on handling COVID, once a strength, are also now underwater, with 43% approving and 53% disapproving, according to the poll. HOUSE DEMOCRATS REELECTION CHAIR CALLS FOR ROLLING BACK COVID RESTRICTIONS TO ‘GIVE PEOPLE THEIR LIVES BACK’ Biden has chosen to follow the lead of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which still recommends universal masking indoors and in schools.  But with the midterms ahead, many Democrats who once led the way in issuing lockdown orders and mandates over the course of the pandemic are easing restrictions in their states in defiance of the administration. Numerous blue state governors this week have announced that they are rolling back coronavirus restrictions, and prominent congressional Democrats have also signaled their support for returning to normal.  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that her state will end its COVID-19 mandate requiring face coverings in most indoor public settings but will keep it for schools. Illinois announced the same.  Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said Wednesday his state will end its indoor vaccine-or-mask requirement this week, followed by the school mask mandate in March. Massachusetts, which is generally considered a blue state but has a centrist Republican governor, will end its school mask mandate at the end of the month.  Earlier this week, New Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware all disclosed plans to join states that have lifted or never had mask requirements for their schools.  Swing states like Michigan, Colorado and Pennsylvania were among the first Democrat-led states to loosen COVID-19 restrictions last year. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is up for reelection this year, implemented some of the strictest COVID-19 orders in the country in 2020, including banning travel between two residences and the selling of non-essential goods. She lifted most of her restrictions last summer and has since pushed vaccinations as the best way to slow the spread.  Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is also up for reelection, has taken a similar approach and refused to implement any new mandates. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, who is unable to run again this year, leaving his seat up for grabs, said in December, ""Local municipalities, as you know, I think ought to be free to do with what they want,"" echoing what many Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have been vilified for saying for the past two years. Less than a year ago, Biden said the lifting of mask mandates in Republican-led states amounted to ""Neanderthal thinking."" President Biden speaks in the East Room of the White House, Jan. 31, 2022, in Washington. (Associated Press) The movement to ""move on"" from the pandemic appears to have sped up in recent days as new coronavirus cases decrease following the omicron variant surge. Also expediting matters: A new Johns Hopkins study saying the lockdowns of 2020 did little to curb the COVID-19 death rate and a new guidance Friday by the CDC saying the popular cloth masks accepted by most mandates are the least effective in preventing the spread. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who barely eked out a win in the reliably blue Garden State in November, was the first to lift his school mask mandate this week after the new CDC guidance, and Democratic governors in California, Delaware, Oregon, Connecticut and New York quickly followed course.  ""We are not going to manage COVID to zero,"" Murphy said Monday on Twitter. ""We have to learn how to live with COVID as we move from a pandemic to an endemic phase of this virus."" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is seen in New Brunswick, New Jersey, Oct. 28, 2021. (Getty Images) ""Our statewide indoor mask requirement will expire on 2/15,"" California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is up for reelection this fall, tweeted Monday. ""Unvaccinated people will still need to wear masks indoors."" ""Oregonians have stepped up during the omicron surge — wearing masks, getting vaccinated and boosted and keeping each other safe,"" Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, who is unable to run for reelection announced Monday. ""Because of your actions, Oregon will lift mask requirements no later than March 31."" ""We are lifting DE's statewide mask mandate for indoor public settings at 8am on Friday, Feb 11,"" Delaware Gov. John Carney tweeted Monday. ""The mask requirement in K-12 public & private schools and child care facilities expires at 11:59pm on Thursday, March 31."" ""It’s about time to end the statewide school mask mandate and enable each local boards of education to decide what is best for their schools,"" Connecticut Gov. Ted Lamont, who is up for reelection, tweeted Wednesday. ""At this time, we say that it’s the right decision to lift this mandate for indoor businesses and let counties, cities and businesses to make their own decisions on what they want to do with respect to mask or vaccination requirement,"" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is running to keep the governor's seat, said Wednesday, dropping her state’s ""mask or vax"" mandate for businesses. The shift in Democratic messaging surrounding the pandemic was buoyed in part by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s upset win in Virginia in November. Focus group findings by Third Way, a think tank aligned with Democrats, found that swing voters who voted for Youngkin over Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe were motivated by COVID-19 restrictions and school closures even more so than critical race theory being taught in the classroom, NBC News reported. MSNBC, OTHERS HIT AS ‘HYPOCRITES’ FOR CONTRADICTORY COVERAGE ON YOUNGKIN, MURPHY MASK MANDATE ORDERS House Democrats' reelection arm has picked up on this messaging ahead of the midterms, where Democrats face an uphill battle to hold onto their razor-thin majorities in the House and Senate. ""Democrats' plan to fight COVID is working — cases are down & vaccines are widely available,"" Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, tweeted Wednesday. ""Now, it's time to give people their lives back. With science as our guide, we're ready to start getting back to normal.""  ""People are ready to pivot"" from the pandemic, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday. It’s a stark contrast to what the left was saying just a month ago when Youngkin banned school mask mandates in Virginia. ""Kids will die,"" CNN political pundit Joe Lockhart tweeted three weeks ago. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Despite the relaxing of COVID restrictions by multiple Democratic governors, Biden is sticking by the CDC, and White House press secretary Jen Psaki has downplayed any apparent conflict between the governors and his administration.

"Biden announces executive order to expand gun background checks, calls on lawmakers to go farther","Biden announces executive order to expand gun background checks, calls on lawmakers to go farther New York City Mayor Eric Adams talked about the separation of church and state Tuesday, and said ""I can't separate my belief because I'm an elected official."" President Biden on Tuesday announced a new executive order aimed at combating gun violence in the U.S.  The president discussed these efforts during an afternoon speech in Monterey Park, California, the city where a gunman stormed a dance hall in January, killing 11 people and injuring others after a Lunar New Year celebration.  President Joe Biden speaks on efforts to reduce gun violence at The Boys & Girls Club of West San Gabriel Valley, Tuesday, March 14, 2023, in Monterey Park, Calif. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) After paying homage to the victims, Biden said the executive order would ""accelerate and intensify"" this work to saving ""more lives more quickly.""  The executive order aims to increase the number of background checks to buy guns, promote more secure firearms storage and ensure U.S. law enforcement agencies are getting the most out of a bipartisan gun control law enacted last summer. ILLINOIS REGULATORY BODY SEEKS LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANCE IN CONCEALED CARRY CONTROVERSY The president’s order does not change U.S. government policy but directs federal agencies to ensure compliance with existing laws and procedures — a typical feature of executive orders issued by presidents when they confront the limits of their own power to act without cooperation from Congress. The order directs the Cabinet to work on a plan to better structure the government to support communities suffering from gun violence. The plan calls on Attorney General Merrick Garland to shore up the rules for federally licensed gun dealers so they know they are required to do background checks as part of the license.

Hong) Biden is also mandating better reporting of ballistics data from federal law enforcement for a clearinghouse that allows federal, state and local law enforcement to match shell casings to guns. But local and state law enforcement agencies are not required to report ballistics data, and many do not, making the clearinghouse less effective. And the president is asking the Federal Trade Commission to issue a public report analyzing how gun manufacturers market to minors and use military images to market to the public. SUSPECTED JULY 4 PARADE SHOOTER HAD BOMB-MAKING MATERIALS IN APARTMENT, WARRANT CLAIMS Biden will also direct his Cabinet to make sure law enforcement agencies understand the benefits of the new law, particularly around red-flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection orders, which are intended to temporarily remove guns from people with potentially violent behavior and prevent them from hurting themselves or others.

Ted Cruz asks Stanford to punish students who heckled Trump-appointed judge,"Ted Cruz asks Stanford to punish students who heckled Trump-appointed judge Senator Ted Cruz discusses his 2024 Senate race and the presidential election with Fox News Digital on the sidelines of a Club for Growth donor conference in Palm Beach, Florida, on March 3, 2023. EXCLUSIVE: Sen. Ted Cruz on Tuesday called on Stanford University to punish the group of law school students responsible for heckling a Trump-appointed judge who was invited to speak at the California college last week. ""It was deeply disturbing to watch the viral video that captured Stanford Law students harassing and insulting Judge Kyle Duncan, a sitting federal circuit judge, who had been invited by the school’s Federalist Society chapter to speak at a school-sanctioned event,"" Cruz wrote in a letter to top Stanford University officials on Tuesday, obtained by Fox News Digital. Cruz said their behavior violates the school's campus disruption policy, and that steps should be taken against  the students. ""Stanford Law School is well within its rights to discipline these students for their behavior, and indeed, I strongly urge the school to do so,"" Cruz wrote. A video widely shared on social media shows dozens of Stanford law students loudly interrupting Duncan before he could give his prepared remarks at the event. Associate Dean for diversity, equity and inclusion Tirien Steinbach soon took control of the event and lectured Duncan that he had ""done harm"" with his work on the U.S Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

North Carolina Gov. Cooper announces new violence prevention office,"North Carolina Gov. Cooper announces new violence prevention office Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper announced on Tuesday his administration would create an office aimed at helping local law enforcement and public health officials reduce violence in their communities through trainings, model programs and assistance to access funding from the federal government and elsewhere. During the Executive Mansion event, which was attended by gun-violence prevention advocates, lawmakers and others, Cooper signed an executive order creating the Office of Violence Prevention within the Department of Public Safety. The new office will coordinate efforts across state and local departments to reverse infamous trends of violence. Cooper said gunfire has surpassed car accidents as the leading cause of injury deaths among children, while in 2021 children in North Carolina were 51% more likely to die from gun violence than children nationwide. ""Too many families and communities are enduring the tragic injuries and deaths from homicide, from carelessness, from suicide,"" Cooper said at the event. ""And whether a gun is used or not, violence is a tragedy that has to be stopped. It requires an all-hands-on-deck approach."" NORTH CAROLINA DEMOCRAT WESLEY HARRIS ANNOUNCES HIS RUN FOR TREASURER IN 2024 One approach could originate from activities conducted by the One Step Further Gate City Coalition community violence prevention program in Greensboro. The program includes volunteers who go into high-crime areas and work to diffuse conflicts by speaking with crime victims and those who wish to do others harm. It's resulted in a 30% reduction in aggravated assaults in the program's target areas since 2019, said program manager Ingram Haizlip, herself a shooting victim in 2011. ""Violence prevention programs include community members who understand our community, look like our community, talk like our community, empathize with our community and love our community one block at a time,"" Haizlip said. An executive director will be hired for the office in the coming months, Cooper said. The Department of Public Safety is already making plans for a statewide public awareness campaign launching in June about the safe storage of firearms. North Carolina Gov.

The former president also received 48% support among individuals ages 18 to 45, while DeSantis received only 30% support among the age group. According to the poll, DeSantis leads Trump among voters 40 and over, 40% to 35%.

Arkansas Gov. Sanders signs trans care malpractice bill into law,"Arkansas Gov. Sanders signs trans care malpractice bill into law Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has signed into law legislation making it easier to sue providers of gender-affirming care for children, a move that could effectively reinstate a blocked ban on such care. Sanders on Monday signed the new law, which won't take effect until this summer. It would allow anyone who received gender-affirming care as a minor to file a malpractice lawsuit against their doctor for up to 15 years after they turn 18. Under current Arkansas law, medical malpractice claims must be filed within two years of an injury. Legal experts have said the change could close access to gender-affirming care for children by making it nearly impossible for providers to get malpractice insurance. The new law is among a growing number of bills targeting transgender people, who have faced increasingly hostile rhetoric at statehouses. At least 175 bills targeting trans people have been introduced in statehouses so far this year, the most in a single year, according to the Human Rights Campaign. AK OFFICIALS INVESTIGATING THE DEATH OF 18-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO WAS FOUND DEAD IN A MISSISSIPPI NATIONAL FOREST Arkansas Gov. Sanders signed a transgender care malpractice bill into a law. This law allows the recipient of a gender-affirming surgery to file a malpractice lawsuit against their doctor.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The bill was signed as a federal judge is considering whether to strike down a 2021 Arkansas law that would prohibit doctors from providing gender-affirming hormone therapy or puberty blockers to anyone under 18 — or referring them to other doctors who can provide that care. No gender-affirming surgery is performed on minors in the state. U.S. District Judge Jay Moody temporarily blocked the law in 2021. Arkansas was the first state to enact such a ban, and several states have approved similar restrictions. A ban in Alabama has also been blocked by a federal judge. The new law won't take effect until 90 days after the Legislature adjourns this year's session, which isn't expected to happen until next month at the earliest.

Chelsea braced for Kepa Arrizabalaga bids and open to summer exit,"Chelsea braced for Kepa Arrizabalaga bids and open to summer exit Chelsea are braced for bids for Kepa Arrizabalaga this summer and are unlikely to stand in the goalkeeper’s way if they receive a suitable offer. The Spain international has had a mixed time since leaving Athletic Bilbao for £71.6m in 2018 and his recent improvement has not been enough to dislodge Édouard Mendy as Thomas Tuchel’s first choice. Tuchel is considering whether to bring Mendy into the side when Chelsea face Palmeiras in the Club World Cup final on Saturday and Arrizabalaga, who impressed in the semi-final victory over Al-Hilal on Wednesday, could look for a fresh challenge at the end of the season. Arrizabalaga’s form has improved since Tuchel replaced Frank Lampard last year and Chelsea believe he could be a summer target for one of the big Spanish clubs. The 27-year-old has done well when given opportunities this season and Chelsea accept he will not want to continue as their No 2 if he has a chance to play regularly elsewhere. Chelsea have not had to deal with any offers for Arrizabalaga. He struggled under Lampard and his asking price and high wages meant that interest was minimal. However, Chelsea know that having such an expensive goalkeeper on the bench regularly is not ideal and there would be more disappointment for Arrizabalaga if he is left out against Palmeiras. Arrizabalaga, who has made tweaks to his game under Tuchel, impressed while Mendy was representing Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations. He helped Chelsea reach the Carabao Cup final at Tottenham’s expense last month, made two stunning saves in the second half against Al-Hilal and has become an expert at saving penalties. He has played a key role in Chelsea winning three shootouts this season and denied Ryan Hardie from the spot when Tuchel’s side knocked Plymouth out of the FA Cup last weekend. Although the feeling at Chelsea is that Arrizabalaga should be Spain’s No 1 instead of Unai Simón or David de Gea, Tuchel could still drop him against Palmeiras. Mendy has joined the Chelsea squad in Abu Dhabi after winning Afcon and has emerged as one of the best goalkeepers in the world since leaving Rennes in 2020. Chelsea have never won the Club World Cup and Tuchel could decide he does not want to leave anything to chance. If Arrizabalaga is dropped against the Copa Libertadores champions, his next chance to impress could come in the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool on 27 February. Chelsea are yet to end the uncertainty hanging over their defence, with César Azpilicueta, Antonio Rüdiger and Andreas Christensen out of contract this summer. However, they have resumed talks with Rüdiger over a new deal and hope to reach an agreement with the centre-back, who is a target for Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain."
"Federal investigators examined Trump Media for possible money laundering, sources say","Federal investigators examined Trump Media for possible money laundering, sources say New York prosecutors expanded criminal inquiry of company last year and examined acceptance of $8m with suspected Russian ties Federal prosecutors in New York involved in the criminal investigation into Donald Trump’s social media company last year started examining whether it violated money laundering statutes in connection with the acceptance of $8m with suspected Russian ties, according to sources familiar with the matter. The company – Trump Media, which owns Trump’s Truth Social platform – initially came under criminal investigation over its preparations for a potential merger with a blank check company called Digital World that was also the subject of an earlier probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Towards the end of last year, federal prosecutors started examining two loans totaling $8m wired to Trump Media, through the Caribbean, from two obscure entities that both appear to be controlled in part by the relation of an ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin, the sources said. The expanded nature of the criminal investigation, which has not been previously reported, threatens to delay the completion of the merger between Trump Media and Digital World, which would provide the company and Truth Social with up to $1.3bn in capital, in addition to a stock market listing. Even if Trump Media and its officers face no criminal exposure for the transactions, the optics of borrowing money from potentially unsavory sources through opaque conduits could cloud Trump’s image as he seeks to recapture the White House in 2024. The extent of the exposure for Trump Media and its officers for money laundering remains unclear. The statutes broadly require prosecutors to show that defendants knew the money was the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity and the transaction was designed to conceal its source. But money laundering prosecutions are typically based on circumstantial evidence and can be based on materials that show that the money in question was unlikely to have legitimate origins, legal experts said. The first $2m payment to Trump Media came in December 2021 when the company was on the brink of collapse after the planned merger with Digital World – that would have unlocked millions for the company – was delayed when the SEC opened an inquiry into whether the arrangement broke regulatory rules. Trump Media needed a bridge loan to keep the company afloat. But it struggled to get financing until Digital World’s chief executive Patrick Orlando sourced a $2m loan wired from Paxum Bank registered in Dominica, according to the wire transfer receipt reviewed by the Guardian. The wire transfer identified Paxum Bank as the beneficial owner, although the promissory note identified an entity called ES Family Trust as the lender. Two months later, an unexpected second $6m payment arrived in Trump Media’s account from ES Family Trust, the transfer receipt showed. In both instances, Orlando declined to provide details about the true identity of the lenders or the origin of the money to Trump Media executives, Trump Media’s since-ousted co-founder turned whistleblower Will Wilkerson recounted in an interview. Though the two payments to Trump Media ostensibly came from two separate entities – first Paxum Bank and second ES Family Trust – the trustee of ES Family Trust, a person called Angel Pacheco, appears to have simultaneously been a director of Paxum Bank. The Russian connection, as being examined by prosecutors in the US attorney’s office for the southern district of New York, centers on a part-owner of Paxum Bank – an individual named Anton Postolnikov, who appears to be a relation of Putin ally Aleksandr Smirnov. Smirnov, who heads the Russia-controlled maritime company Rosmorport, worked in the Central Office of the Russian government until 2017. Before that, Smirnov was the First Deputy Minister of Justice of Russia until 2014, and for most of Putin’s first two terms as president, Smirnov served in the executive office of the president. A spokesman for the justice department, the US attorney’s office for the southern district of New York and outside counsel for Trump Media declined to comment about the investigation. Rosmorport and Paxum Bank did not respond to requests for comment. Concern inside Trump Media The obscure origins about the $8m loans caused alarm at Trump Media and, in the spring of 2022, Trump Media’s then-chief financial officer Phillip Juhan weighed returning the money, according to Wilkerson. But the money was never returned, Wilkerson said, in part because losing $8m out of the roughly $12m cash that Trump Media had in its accounts at that time would have placed significant stress on its financial situation.Prosecutors appear to have also taken a special interest in the payments because the off-shore Paxum Bank has a history of providing banking services for the pornography and sex worker industries, which makes it higher risk of engaging in money laundering and other illicit financing. There appears to have been some awareness at Trump Media that the first $2m was to come through because Trump’s eldest son Don Jr, who joined the board with Trump ally Kash Patel and former Republican-turned Trump Media chief executive Devin Nunes, had confirmed to the company’s lawyers to proceed with the transaction. “Just want to keep you in the loop – no guaranty that these will get signed and funded, but we remain hopeful,” John Haley, outside counsel for Trump Media said in a 24 December 2021 email seen by the Guardian, to which Don Jr replied: “Thanks john much appreciated. d.” Since Orlando, who arranged the $8m financing, is an SEC-licensed broker-dealer, he would be subject to SEC rules governing anti-money laundering and “Know Your Customer” requirements that mandate due diligence of investors to combat the proliferation of illicit money. As a private company arranging private loans, the obligations for Trump Media to vet the financing under the SEC rules are less clear. But the securities regulations are separate to the US criminal money laundering statutes, which apply universally. A spokesman for Don Jr declined to comment. Orlando, Nunes, Patel and Juhan did not respond to requests for comment. Federal prosecutors’ interest in the two payments appear to have started when Wilkerson, through his attorneys Patrick Mincey, Stephen Bell and Phil Brewster, alerted the US attorney’s office for the southern district of New York to the payments on 23 October 2022. Trump was the chairman of Trump Media at the time, though it was unclear whether he was aware of the opaque nature of the two loans. Trump typically did not seem to be particularly interested in managing the day-to-day running of Trump Media, Wilkerson said. But Trump was interested in the deal, Wilkerson said, because he got to own 90% of the shares without putting in any money into the company. According to one source familiar with the matter, however, Trump invested some money into Digital World, which could allow him to cash out twice in the event the merger was consummated."
Awesome Erling Haaland hits five as Manchester City demolish RB Leipzig,"Awesome Erling Haaland hits five as Manchester City demolish RB Leipzig It was the moment when RB Leipzig’s shattered players could exhale. There were 62 minutes on the clock and a bright, red No 9 on the Manchester City substitutes’ board. For the German club, the ordeal was over. Erling Haaland was coming off. As City’s wrecking ball of a centre-forward departed, a broad smile on his lips, there was a slightly awed burst of applause from all sides, Pep Guardiola joining in on the touchline. Haaland had previously scored four hat-tricks in City colours during a season in which he has relentlessly dismantled records. But five in one game? And a Champions League last-16 tie, at that? This was extra special and everybody knew it. When Haaland scored his fifth and City’s sixth, extending the fingers and thumb on one hand and asking the fans to count them, his father, Alfie, celebrating wildly in the stands, it gave him 39 goals for the season; a new club record – taking him past Tommy Johnson’s 38 from 1928-29. What this masterclass of bullying power, hard running and lethal shooting did was send a message across Europe. Guardiola has been getting closer to the holy grail of a Champions League win with City, a final and a semi-final in the past two seasons. With Haaland now on board, the possibilities are tantalising, especially with the business end of the tournament looking so open. City equalled their record win in it – the 7-0 against Schalke from 2019 – when Kevin De Bruyne curled home a stoppage-time beauty. De Bruyne was very good on his return to the starting XI but this was an occasion that was transcended by one man. It was Haaland’s 36th appearance for City and the club will play a minimum of 14 more games in all competitions before the end of the season; a maximum of 19 as they chase glory in the Premier League, the FA Cup and this competition – the one that they crave. Goodness knows what his numbers will look like when it is all over. One of the things about Haaland is that he is plainly having so much fun – witness the goal celebrations, even the grins after he goes close; the same when he watched from the bench here after his withdrawal and, obviously, when he wandered off with the match-ball. He almost took home two. But it is the remorselessness that underpins everything, the desire to chase causes which appear lost, to put himself about and make things happen. Once the chance is there, it normally means only one thing. And if it does not, it probably will do the next time. Haaland’s second goal was the perfect illustration of his hustle, athleticism and predatory instinct. He forced the Leipzig goalkeeper, Janis Blaswich, to rush a clearance and, when Manuel Akanji volleyed back from halfway, Haaland twisted to nod back to De Bruyne. What followed was all about the purity of De Bruyne’s technique, a run in traffic followed by a scorching drive that came back off the crossbar. Haaland devoured the rebound. Haaland’s first had been a controversial penalty, not that he had any time for sympathy after the VAR stunned Leipzig by asking the referee, Slavko Vincic, to consult the pitchside monitor. The footage showed that a Rodri header on a City corner had gone into the arm of Benjamin Henrichs, which was outstretched, albeit the Leipzig full-back had his back to the ball as he jumped. It was the definition of a letter of the law decision, so harsh. Haaland battered the kick past Blaswich. Leipzig were almost comically bad, from back to front, everything going against them, including the moment on 34 minutes when Ederson left his area and cleaned out Konrad Laimer only to Vincic to say no to the foul and book an incredulous Timo Werner for dissent. Sign up to Football Daily Kick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of football after newsletter promotion City could have had more during a golden first period, although Jack Grealish did blot his copybook with an attempted dive in the area. Ilkay Gündogan had blasted high at the outset while Haaland motored onto a long ball that he had no right to reach and almost prodded past Blaswich. At 2-0, Haaland hammered for the near corner only for the goalkeeper to save while Gundogan also extended him after a quick De Bruyne free-kick. Leipzig’s task became impossible after Haaland’s final act of the first half. Rúben Dias’s header from a corner had kissed the inside of the post and run across the line, Amadou Haidara trying to spin and clear but he could feel Haaland behind him. City’s No 9 practically tackled the ball in. He will get you whichever way. Haaland was not sated. Far from it. He would profit from two more corners after the interval, lashing home a pair of rebounds. Gündogan had scored the fourth straight after half-time, driving low into the far corner to draw the thousand-yard stare from the Leipzig manager, Marco Rose, and the ordeal could not end quickly enough for the visitors, even after the mercy move of Haaland’s substitution. It can often feel that Guardiola’s Champions League story at City flashes before everyone’s eyes on these kind of nights – majoring on the knock-out round heartbreak – and it had done in a literal sense before kick-off, the big screen montage including footage of him looking sad after defeats and consoling broken players. “This season feels a little bit different,” was the upbeat message at the end. Haaland intends to make it so."
Miscalculation fears rise after Russian fighter jet collides with US drone over Black Sea,"Miscalculation fears rise after Russian fighter jet collides with US drone over Black Sea US accuses Russia of ‘unsafe and unprofessional’ intercept of MQ-9 Reaper drone over waters west of Crimea  See all our Ukraine coverage A Russian fighter has collided with a US Reaper drone, forcing it down into the Black Sea, in what US forces called an “unsafe and unprofessional” intercept. A US European Command statement said the collision happened just after 7am on Tuesday morning, when two Russian Su-27 fighter jets flew up to the MQ-9 Reaper drone over international waters west of Crimea. The statement said the Russian pilots sought to disrupt the US aircraft before the collision. “Several times before the collision, the Su-27s dumped fuel on and flew in front of the MQ-9 in a reckless, environmentally unsound and unprofessional manner,” the US statement said. “This incident demonstrates a lack of competence in addition to being unsafe and unprofessional.” One of the Russian fighters then struck the drone’s propeller, “causing US forces to have to bring the MQ-9 down in international waters”. The Pentagon spokesman, Brig Gen Patrick Ryder, said the Russian planes were in close proximity to the drone for about half an hour, and that the Su-27 which struck it was probably damaged. “It essentially ran into the MQ-9,” Ryder said. It is believed the Russian Su-27 landed at an airbase in occupied Crimea. Russia’s defence ministry denied there was any collision and suggested the drone was brought down through pilot mishandling. The downing of the $32m drone triggered a race to recover the wreckage, as it contains some of the most advanced US technology and would be an intelligence windfall for Russia if it got to the aircraft first. “To my knowledge, at this point in time, the Russians have not recovered that aircraft,” Gen Ryder said on Tuesday afternoon. The European Command statement warned: “These aggressive actions by Russian aircrew are dangerous and could lead to miscalculation and unintended escalation.” “Our MQ-9 aircraft was conducting routine operations in international airspace when it was intercepted and hit by a Russian aircraft, resulting in a crash and complete loss of the MQ-9,” Gen James Hecker, the US air force commander for Europe and Africa, said. “In fact, this unsafe and unprofessional act by the Russians nearly caused both aircraft to crash.” Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement that its fighters “did not use airborne weapons and did not come into contact” with the US drone. The ministry said that fighters from its air defence forces were scrambled to identify the drone which the ministry claimed was heading “in direction of the state border of the Russian Federation”. “As a result of sharp manoeuvring around 9.30 (Moscow time), the MQ-9 unmanned aerial vehicle went into uncontrolled flight with a loss of altitude and collided with the water surface,” the ministry said, adding that its fighter jets returned safely to their base. It is the first collision between Russian and Nato aircraft since Russia’s full-scale invasion just over a year ago, but it has highlighted the dangers of a clash leading to escalation through mistake or miscalculation as Russia and Nato forces field increasing amounts of military hardware around Ukraine – risks heightened by reckless behaviour. “This is my biggest worry, both there and in the Pacific, that an aggressive Russian or Chinese pilot or vessel captain gets too close, doesn’t realize where they are and causes a collision,” the head of the US Marine Corps, Gen David Berger, said. The European Command statement said that the incident was part of a “pattern of dangerous actions by Russian pilots while interacting with US and allied aircraft over international airspace, including over the Black Sea”. In the White House on Tuesday, the national security council spokesman, John Kirby, said: “It is not the first time certainly in recent weeks there’s been intercepts.” But Kirby added: “It is the first time that an intercept resulted in the ‘splashing’ of one of our drones.” He said that Joe Biden had been briefed on the incident, and the state department spokesman, Ned Price, said the US had summoned the Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov to “convey our strong objections”. He stressed the US drone had been operating over international waters, and that the collision would not deter US forces from patrolling the Black Sea. “US will continue to operate in international airspace over international waters,” Kirby said. “The Black Sea belongs to no one.” Later, Antonov said Moscow views the incident as “a provocation” but said Moscow does not want confrontation with the US. Speaking during a visit to Japan, Ben Wallace, the British defence secretary, urged Moscow to respect international airspace. Dara Massicot, a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation, said that the incident was just the latest in a long series of episodes over many years of what she called “coercive signalling” by Russian forces. This was the first time she was aware of a Russian jet dumping fuel on a Nato aircraft, but she said it “fits with a larger pattern of escalating signals before coming too close to a platform”. “In this case, the SU-27 pilot is said to have hit the propeller, damaging the MQ-9 –probably a pass, intended to compel it to change course – that came too close,” Massicot said on Twitter. Mary Ellen O’Connell, a Notre Dame Law School professor and expert on international law and the use of force, noted that by dumping fuel and downing the drone, the Russian pilot was “further polluting the fragile Black Sea”, but she noted the US had not called the interception “unlawful”. “In all likelihood the Reaper was conducting surveillance for Ukraine. Under the laws of armed conflict Russia may disrupt such assistance,” O’Connell said."
Honeysuckle ends career with Mares’ Hurdle win at Cheltenham Festival,"Honeysuckle ends career with Mares’ Hurdle win at Cheltenham Festival Honeysuckle, the Champion Hurdle winner in 2021 and 2022, brought down the curtain on her brilliant racing career with a 17th victory – her fourth in succession at the Festival – as a trademark burst of speed after the final flight carried her to a one-and-a-half length win in the Mares’ Hurdle. Honeysuckle’s win prompted huge celebrations in the stands but also emotional scenes as she returned to the winner’s enclosure for the final time and thoughts returned to the tragic death of Jack de Bromhead, the son of her trainer, Henry, in a pony-race fall last year. “You dream of the fairytale ending but, so often, it doesn’t happen,” De Bromhead said. “Most of it is for Honey, because she has been so unbelievable, but everyone has shown us so much support. We’re really grateful for that. It’s been an incredibly tough time.

El Fabiolo (Arkle Trophy), Jazzy Matty (Boodles Handicap Hurdle) and Gaillard Du Mesnil (National Hunt Chase) completed an excellent opening day for the visitors. “It’s the best feeling of all time,” Connell, who has also owned and ridden winners at the course but was celebrating his first win as a trainer, said afterwards. “I put a lot of pressure on myself, saying he was the best horse I’ve ever had. He’s very, very quick. He’s unlike any other horse we’ve had before. They were mainly stayers, this is a quick horse [and] today was his day. “I enjoy [training] about 150% more. I love being with the horses, going round the yard, going out on to the gallops, talking to the staff. I think we’ll come back here for the Arkle [over fences] next year. Those are my initial thoughts at this period in time, but today is for enjoying today.”"
Internazionale hold off Porto to reach quarter-finals for first time in 12 years,"Internazionale hold off Porto to reach quarter-finals for first time in 12 years Internazionale reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the first time since 2011 after a goalless draw in Porto secured their progression. Romelu Lukaku’s goal four minutes from the end of the first leg was enough to see Inter through, where they join their city rivals Milan. Mehdi Taremi came within inches of forcing the tie to extra time when he rattled the crossbar in the closing stages. The Portuguese side were reduced to 10 men in the seventh minute of injury time when the winger Pepê was shown a second yellow card. On-loan Chelsea striker Lukaku came on for Inter 20 minutes from time, replacing Edin Dzeko who had come closest to scoring for Simone Inzaghi’s side with a low effort that was saved by Diogo Costa. The Inter goalkeeper André Onana made several crucial saves late on to ensure they hung on to their slender lead. “We played an excellent game, the group stayed compact and played a great match. Excellent first half,” Inzaghi told Mediaset afterwards. “In the last part of the match we all suffered together – honour to this group.” “In football, luck matters relatively,” the Inter head coach added. “In the two-legged match, we deserved to advance.

Pakistan: riot police fire teargas on crowds trying to prevent arrest of Imran Khan,"Pakistan: riot police fire teargas on crowds trying to prevent arrest of Imran Khan It is the second time in recent weeks that police have been dispatched to serve an arrest warrant to the former prime minister Pakistan riot police have used water cannon and teargas to push back supporters of former prime minister Imran Khan who gathered outside his house to prevent officers from arresting him. Khan was ousted from office by a no confidence vote last year, and has been snarled in a series of legal cases as he campaigns for early elections and his return to office. It is the second time in recent weeks that police have been dispatched from the capital Islamabad to Khan’s home in the eastern city of Lahore to serve an arrest warrant after he skipped several court dates linked to a corruption case, citing security concerns. “We are here basically to execute the warrants and to arrest him,” Syed Shahzad Nadeem Bukhari, deputy inspector general of Islamabad police, told reporters outside Khan’s residence in Lahore on Tuesday. Officers were met by at least 200 Khan supporters, some wielding sticks and hurling stones, draped in the red and green flags of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. Police fired a water cannon and teargas on the crowds as they attempted to clear a path to Khan’s house, holding signs plastered with the arrest warrant for the 70-year-old opposition leader. Khan issued a video recorded from inside the house, sitting in front of Pakistan and PTI flags at a desk decorated with spent teargas canisters. “I am telling the entire nation today that they are ready once again, they’re going to come again,” he said. “They will teargas our people and do other such things, but you should know that they have no justification to do so.” Video circulating on social media – much of it distributed by official PTI accounts – showed several bloodied supporters and others struggling to cope with teargas. A PTI official tweeted that there was “an urgent need” for first aid kits at the Zaman Park neighbourhood. A party account also showed video of teargas canisters landing inside Khan’s garden, but police did not appear to breach the gate or the wall. “The way the police attack our people … there is no precedent for this,” Khan said. PTI deputy leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi told reporters on Tuesday that “we want to be peaceful”. Qureshi insisted police should deliver the arrest warrant to Khan and said he would “try to find a solution to avoid bloodshed”. Khan has been summoned to court to answer accusations he did not declare gifts received during his time as prime minister, or the profit made from selling them. The first attempt officers made to detain the onetime cricket superstar was thwarted because he was “reluctant to surrender”, police said, without offering further details. Khan has been pressuring the coalition government which replaced him, led by prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, with popular rallies and daily addresses. Last year he was shot in the leg at a demonstration, an assassination bid he blamed on Sharif. As the political melodrama unfolds ahead of an election due no later than October, Pakistan is in the grip of a stark economic downturn, risking default if help cannot be secured from the International Monetary Fund. The security situation is also deteriorating with a spate of deadly attacks on police headquarters, linked to the Pakistan Taliban."
Silicon Valley Bank: why did it collapse and is this the start of a banking crisis?,"Silicon Valley Bank: why did it collapse and is this the start of a banking crisis? Until last Friday Silicon Valley Bank was the 16th largest bank in the US, worth more than $200bn Four decades ago, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was born in the heart of a region known for its technological prowess and savvy decision making. The California-headquartered organisation grew to become the 16th largest bank in the US, catering for the financial needs of technology companies around the world, before a series of ill-fated investment decisions led to its collapse. As the preferred bank for the tech sector, SVB’s services were in hot demand throughout the pandemic years. The initial market shock of Covid-19 in early 2020 quickly gave way to a golden period for startups and established tech companies, as consumers spent big on gadgets and digital services. Many tech companies used SVB to hold the cash they used for payroll and other business expenses, leading to an influx of deposits. The bank invested a large portion of the deposits, as banks do. The seeds of its demise were sown when it invested heavily in long-dated US government bonds, including those backed by mortgages. These were, for all intents and purposes, as safe as houses. But bonds have an inverse relationship with interest rates; when rates rise, bond prices fall. So when the Federal Reserve started to hike rates rapidly to combat inflation, SVB’s bond portfolio started to lose significant value. If SVB were able to hold those bonds for a number of years until they mature, then it would receive its capital back. However, as economic conditions soured over the last year, with tech companies particularly affected, many of the bank’s customers started drawing on their deposits. SVB didn’t have enough cash on hand, and so it started selling some of its bonds at steep losses, spooking investors and customers. It took just 48 hours between the time it disclosed that it had sold the assets and its collapse. Given banks only keep a portion of their assets as cash, they are susceptible to a rush of demand from customers. While SVB’s problems stem from its earlier investment decisions, the run was triggered on 8 March, when it announced a $1.75bn capital raising. It told investors it needed to plug a hole caused by the sale of its loss-making bond portfolio. “Suddenly everyone became alarmed that the bank was short of capital,” says Fariborz Moshirian, professor at UNSW and director of the Institute of Global Finance. Customers were now aware of the deep financial problems at SVB, and started withdrawing money en masse. Unlike a retail bank that caters for business and households, SVB’s clients tended to have much larger accounts. This meant the bank run was swift. Two days after it announced it would raise capital, the US$200bn company collapsed, marking the largest bank failure in the US since the global financial crisis. Immediate concerns of widespread contagion have been contained by the US government’s quick response in guaranteeing all deposits of the banks customers. Financial futures, which allow investors to speculate on future price movements, rallied for the US technology sector in response to the guarantees. There had been concerns that if that guarantee wasn’t implemented, SVB account holders would not have been able to pay employees, sending ripples through the economy. “In terms of stability, they’ve avoided supply chain consequences,” says Moshirian. Governments and regulators around the world, including in the UK and Australia, are checking for SVB exposure in their corporate and banking sectors. The longer term questions is whether SVB’s vulnerability to rising interest rates is paralleled in other banks through an over-exposure to falling bond prices. While Moshirian says he doesn’t think the banking system is about to unravel, he notes that people also initially felt that the sub-prime mortgage crisis was contained. That went on to spark the global financial crisis. To counter the risk, the Federal Reserve has unveiled a new program that allows banks to borrow funds backed by government securities to meet demands from deposit customers. This is designed to prevent banks from being forced to sell government bonds, for example, that have been losing value due to rising rates. There are, however, more immediate concerns for the technology sector. SVB catered for Silicon Valley, backing startups and other technology companies that traditional banks might shy away from. In recent months, the sector has been cutting staff as economic conditions deteriorate. At a time they need financial backing, one of its biggest supporters has collapsed. The government is not saving SVB; it will stay collapsed – or wound up with remaining assets dispersed to creditors – unless a buyer can bring it back to life. However, late on Sunday US agencies extended a guarantee to cover all deposits at the bank, as well as for customers at a second smaller institution, Signature Bank, that collapsed over the weekend. It means customers at SVB will be able to access all their money on Monday morning. Shareholders in the bank and some unsecured creditors aren’t protected by the guarantees. Central banks around the world have been raising rates over the past year to tame high inflation, with the US moving from near zero to more than 4.5% at a rapid pace. Most forecasters expect rates to go higher in the US, UK and Australia, before stabilising. The appetite to keep raising rates will now be tested if central banks become concerned that SVB’s problems are indicative of a broader weakness in corporate balance sheets caused by rising rates."
Virus outbreak in West Bengal leaves 19 children dead and thousands in hospital,"Virus outbreak in West Bengal leaves 19 children dead and thousands in hospital Indian state in crisis after adenovirus hits 12,000 people this year and families with sick children camp outside Kolkata hospital Nineteen children have died of acute respiratory infections in West Bengal this year, and thousands more are in hospital as India grapples with an adenovirus outbreak. More than 12,000 cases of adenovirus have been recorded in the state since January. More than 3,000 children have been admitted to hospital with severe flu-like symptoms. The Association of Health Service Doctors warns that the numbers of deaths and cases are likely to be much higher than official statistics. Local media reports put the death toll at more than 100 children. The state’s healthcare system is struggling to cope. Some hospitals have said their paediatric wards are full, and there are reports of children having to share hospital beds. Adenoviruses can cause respiratory, eye and stomach infections. Health officials say two mutated adenovirus strains are responsible for the number of sick and dead children. The virus has also been found in Maharashtra and Karnataka states. Helplines have been set up by the local government to handle calls from concerned parents, and the Health and Family Welfare Department has cancelled health workers’ leave to deal with the volume of cases. Clinics have been instructed to open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Protocols used during the Covid pandemic, such as mask-wearing and social distancing, are being introduced to slow infections, although schools have not been ordered to close. “The magnitude and severity of the epidemic is unprecedented,” said paediatrician Apurba Ghosh. Last week, more than 100 families who had travelled with sick children from villages and towns across the state were camped inside the grounds of BC Roy children’s hospital in Kolkata, waiting for news from doctors. Alamin Mollah, from Canning, about 60 miles from the state capital, had brought his one-year-old son to the hospital. The baby was constantly crying and suffering from diarrhoea (another symptom of the adenovirus). Mollah said the doctor back home was not helpful. “The baby was refusing food and water. He was not drinking the ORS [oral rehydration solution]. The doctor said: ‘If the baby is not drinking the ORS, nothing can be done,’ and walked out. He didn’t even bother to examine the child. So we decided to come to Kolkata.” Also at the hospital, a woman from the city of Bangaon said her 10-month-old grandson had died of respiratory failure, having had breathing difficulties and a fever for more than a month. “He was coughing so hard that blood started coming out of his mouth. The doctors told me his lungs had been badly damaged,” she said. On Sunday, the West Bengal government formed an eight-member taskforce to monitor cases and treatment. Doctors who spoke to the Guardian said one reason for the high volume of cases among young children, is because they were not able to build immunity to common infections during Covid lockdowns. They added that paediatric healthcare has not received enough attention in recent years. One health official said “The primary healthcare centres in the state, which are the first point of healthcare intervention, are not equipped with health management for severe paediatric ailments.” Dr Prabhas Prasun Giri, who runs the paediatric intensive care unit at the Institute of Child Health in Kolkata, said the state had not been prepared to deal with the huge influx of patients. “As we live in the post-Covid era, we should be prepared for any such type of virus outbreak. This year, it’s adenovirus. Next year, it may be RSV [respiratory syncytial virus]. Another year, it may be flu,” he said. During the Covid pandemic, adult ICU services were developed to handle infections but paediatric facilities were not, he added. Most private hospitals in Kolkata have adult intensive care units but don’t have paediatric ICUs. “So the most challenging aspect has been accommodating sick children in ICUs,” he said."
